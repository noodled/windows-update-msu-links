# Windows Update MSU Links

An archive of Windows Update MSU links.

The data: [update_links.json](update_links.json).

MSU links can be found in the [Microsoft Update
Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx), but old updates
are no longer listed. Still, links to old updates work. This repository archives
MSU links of Windows 10 and Windows 11 updates, so they can be found in the
future.

The MSU links are updated regularly. Note that when the repository was created,
many updates were already unlisted in the Microsoft Update Catalog. Most of them
were grabbed from alternative sources, including:

As a result, links to some old updates might still be missing.
